      <description>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm, or classification, that organizes a group of data attributes with functions or methods into a unit, known as an object. Typically, OOP languages are class-based, meaning a class defines the data attributes and functions as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class. One class may represent multiple independent objects, which interact with each other in complex ways.
