Today was the third day of the entrepreneurship boot camp with Dr. Mena Kerols. I didn't expect to change that much and learn about new stuff like this. These three days boosted my confidence through the roof. I was able to present my ideas in full detail and to stand in front of many people of different ages to discuss my ideas.

I met really wonderful people that I didn't expect to get along with. When the teams were chosen randomly, luck decided for me that I would work on this project with 5 passionate girls. I was a little shy because I had never worked with girls before, but I could handle the situation, bring up good ideas, and we are making a great team. They are very kind and friendly, have big dreams, and that's what really matters.

I also met that one person who studied entrepreneurship for years, has great knowledge on how to start a business, and a wonderful idea (that I will try not to leak). He/she was also a great advisor, gave me a lot of insights, and shared his/her experience with me generously. The fourth day is the day of truth. I will present my idea in front of the judges. It's to be or not to be. I hope I will do well. I'm proud of myself and my team anyway.
