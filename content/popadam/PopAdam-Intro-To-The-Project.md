I have made the decision to revisit the 'Pop Adam' game project, which I had attempted in the past but failed multiple times. Despite the failures, the idea has never left my mind, and now I will give it another shot, documenting my progress along the way.

First, let's take a closer look at the 'Adam's Legacy' BETA game and analyze the reasons that led to my previous difficulties in maintaining progress on it.

1- I tried to create a game without even having a **plan**!

2- I built a **big map **but couldn't handle it.

3- Focused on the **visuals** rather than **quality**.

4- code is organized into so many files that i** can't even trace** it anymore.

5-** Assets and sprites are limited, **so i can't customize the game or do future development for it.

6- And finally the main protagonist doesn't look like adam.

This time i will take my time, reflect on past mistakes, and try to create a small story mode game that consists of quests you have to complete in order to obtain some items or defeat bosses. It will be a series of games, each with a different map and story, but not very big. Characters will be based on real-life individuals; that's the whole point. The game will have simple mechanics, including:
Movement
Attacking
Merchant interactions
Health system
NPCs

and this blog will contain the whole process.
