**Object-orientation** is a way of thinking about problems using models built from real-world concepts.

and i've already made a page for the main concepts in my (OO though process) book summary you WILL need to [check it out](https://albasel.netlify.app/books/object-oriented-thought-process/object-oriented-thought-process/ "check it out").

History of OOP [(Found in linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-did-oop-evolve-from-procedural "(Found in linkedin)")

> **Object-oriented programming has its roots in the research and experiments of computer scientists in the 1960s and 1970s. One of the pioneers of OOP was Ole-Johan Dahl, who along with Kristen Nygaard, developed the first object-oriented language, Simula, in 1967. Simula introduced the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are the core features of OOP. Another influential figure was Alan Kay, who along with his colleagues at Xerox PARC, developed the language Smalltalk in 1972. Smalltalk was the first pure object-oriented language, where everything was an object, even numbers and functions. Smalltalk also introduced the concepts of dynamic typing, garbage collection, and graphical user interface.**

Yea, no one cares.
let's practise some important applications.

**For these tasks, I'll need you to write the implementation in a non-IDE environment. Then, take the plain text and compile it using an IDE. You can even write it on paper if necessary; the goal is to understand how to write it without relying on an IDE or AI assistant.**

Plain Text Editor: https://www.onlinetexteditor.com/
Online Compiler : https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler

or use VIM to both write and compile.

Then send the link of your implementation in the comments to discuss it :smile:

**Task 1:** Write a stack implemented in C using structs. [solution](https://onlinegdb.com/cpIQFkSWW "solution")

**Task 2:** Write a stack implemented in C++ using classes. [solution](https://onlinegdb.com/Z2lGNFPIG "solution")

**Task 3:** Write a stack implemented in C++ using classes and operator overloading [solution](https://onlinegdb.com/_yRE1oirI "solution")

**Task 4:** Write a stack implemented in C using classes,operator overloading, and vectors.


so you will write two implementations and improve it.

first let's think of a diagram for this problem.

that's simple yet powerful.
if we wanted to improve on this we will just add the other operators, functions,etc..
