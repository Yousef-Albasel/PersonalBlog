### More on Delays:
1 -  **Processing Delay:**
   - Caused by the forward table in the network switch. 
   - Check bit errors
   - Determine output link
   - Typically < msec


2-  **Queueing Delay:**
   - time waiting at output link for transmission 
   - depends on congestion level of router


3- **Transmission Delay:**
   - Time taken for data to leave the switch (L/R).

4- **Propagation Delay:**
   - Total time from point A to point B. (D/S)
   - D : Length of physical link
   - S : Propagation Speed 2*10^8  



### Packet loss
- **Queue (aka Buffer):**
  - *Definition:* A storage area preceding a link with finite capacity where packets are temporarily held.
  - *Finite Capacity:* The queue can hold a limited number of packets at a given time.
  - *Packet Arrival:* When a new packet arrives at a full queue, it is dropped (also known as lost) due to the lack of available space.
  - *Retransmission of Lost Packets:* A lost packet may be retransmitted by the previous node, the source end system, or it may not be retransmitted at all.

### Throughput:
  - *Definition:* Rate at which bits are transferred between sender and receiver.
  - *Instantaneous Throughput:* Rate at a specific point in time.
  - *Average Throughput:* Rate observed over a longer period of time.
