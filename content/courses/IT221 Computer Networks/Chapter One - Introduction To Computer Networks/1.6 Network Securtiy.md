### Network Security 

- **Field of Network Security:**
  - *Focus:* Understanding how malicious actors can attack computer networks.
  - *Objective:* Developing defense strategies against network attacks.
  - *Design Goal:* Creating architectures that are resilient and immune to attacks.

- **Internet Security Background:**
  - *Historical Note:* The Internet was not initially designed with significant security considerations.
  - *Original Vision:* Envisioned as "a group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network" â˜º.
  - *Evolution:* Internet protocol designers are playing catch-up to address security concerns.
  - *Current Practice:* Security considerations are integrated into all layers of network design.


Bad guys can attack hosts or servers

### Malware can get in host from:

**Virus:** self-replicating infection by receiving/executing  object (e.g., e-mail attachment)
**Worm:** self-replicating infection by passively receiving object that gets itself executed

- spyware malware can record keystrokes, web sites visited, upload info to collection site
- infected host can be enrolled in  botnet, used for spam. DDoS attacks

And can attack servers by doing DDos attacks

**Denial of Service (DoS):** attackers make resources (server, bandwidth) unavailable to legitimate traffic by overwhelming resource with bogus traffic

**Bad guys can sniff packets**

- **Packet "Sniffing":**
  - *Scenario:* Common in broadcast media like shared Ethernet and wireless networks.
  - *Description:* A promiscuous network interface reads and records all packets, potentially capturing sensitive information like passwords, as they pass by.
