### What’s the Internet: “nuts and bolts” view

The public Internet is a world-wide computer network, i.e., a network that interconnects millions of computing devices throughout the world. 

- End systems, as well as most other "pieces" of the Internet, run protocols that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. TCP (the Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (the Internet Protocol) are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. 

- End systems are connected together by communication links. Links are made up of different types of physical media: coaxial cable, copper wire, fiber optics, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit data at different rates. 

- The link transmission rate is often called  the link bandwidth, and is typically measured in bits/second.

The Internet is really a network of networks.  That is, the Internet is an interconnected set of privately and publicly owned and managed networks.  Any network connected to the Internet must run the IP protocol and conform to certain naming and addressing conventions.The Internet is really a network of networks.
