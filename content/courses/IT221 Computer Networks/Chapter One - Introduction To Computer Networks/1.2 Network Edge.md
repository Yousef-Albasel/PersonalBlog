#### Network Edge

The network edge the connection or interface between a device or local network and the internet. 

it consists of:
#### 1- Hosts:
**Clients and servers servers often in data centers**
#### 2- Access Networks:
**wired, wireless communication links **
#### 3- Core Networks:
**interconnected routers
network of networks**


**Interconnected routers** refer to a network configuration where multiple routers are connected to each other, forming a network of routers.

**Routers** are devices that forward data packets between computer networks, and when they are **interconnected**, they can facilitate the flow of data between different segments of a network.

### Host: sends packets of data
**Host sending function:**
- takes application message
- breaks into smaller chunks, known as packets, of length L bits
- transmits packet into access network at transmission rate R

link transmission rate, aka link capacity, aka link bandwidth

so, time you need to transmit L bits into a link of rate R is **L(bit)/R(bit/s)** also known as **Packet Transmission Rate**

### Access network: digital subscriber line (DSL)
DSL provides dedicated, point-to-point, public network access

voice, data transmitted at different frequencies over dedicated line to central office.

 DSLAM is a network device that is used by the ISP often via locating them in telephone exchanges or distribution points, in order to connect multiple DSL to the internet using multiplexing technique.

### Access network: cable network

**homes share access network to cable headend 
unlike DSL, which has dedicated access to central office**

HFC access network is a type of telecommunications network architecture that combines both fiber optic cables and coaxial cables to provide broadband services, including internet, television, and phone services. This hybrid approach takes advantage of the strengths of both fiber optics and coaxial cables, providing a cost-effective solution for delivering high-speed data to homes and businesses.

### Enterprise access networks (Ethernet)
Ethernet is a family of computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LANs) and larger networks
More to is later, it's mainly used in organizations like companies and universites.

### WAN (Wide Area Network)
shared wireless access network connects end system to router
via base station aka “access point”
- Wireless LANS (WIFI 802.11)
- wide-area wireless access (3G,4G,5G..)


### Physical media

Bit: propagates between
transmitter/receiver pairs

- Physical link: what lies between transmitter & receiver

- Guided media: signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax
- Unguided media: signals propagate freely, e.g., radio

- Twisted pair (TP) two insulated copper wires
Category 5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps Ethernet
Category 6: 10Gbps
