## Network Edge

is mesh of interconnected routers

### Packet-Switching:
- Hosts break application-layer messages into packets

- forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination
- each packet transmitted at full link capacity

**Store and Forward: ** Entire Packet must  arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
end-end delay = 2L/R (assuming zero propagation delay

### Circuit Switching
- **End-to-End Resource Allocation:**
  - Dedicated resources are reserved for the entire duration of a call between the source and destination.

- **No Sharing with Guaranteed Performance:**
  - Circuit switching ensures exclusive use of resources, providing a circuit-like, guaranteed performance.

- **Idle Circuit Segments:**
  - Unused circuit segments remain idle, minimizing resource consumption during inactive periods.

- **Common Usage in Telephony:**
  - Circuit switching is a foundational principle in traditional telephone networks.


### Delays:
1. **Processing Delay:**
   - Caused by the forward table in the network switch.

2. **Queueing Delay:**
   - Delay associated with waiting to be sent to Host 2.

3. **Transmission Delay:**
   - Time taken for data to leave the switch (L/R).

4. **Propagation Delay:**
   - Total time from point A to point B.

Total Delay: Processing + Queuing + Transmission + Propagation
