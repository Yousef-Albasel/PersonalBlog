### File distrubtion Client-Server vs P2P

**Question: how much time to distribute file (size F) from one server to N  peers?**
- peer upload/download capacity is limited resource

- **Time to Distribute File \(F\) to \(N\) Clients (Client-Server Approach):**
  - *Formula:*
    -  Dc-s >= max{NF/us,F/dmin}
Where N is number of files
F is Size for file
us is server upload capacity
dmin is minimum client download rate

- **Time to Distribute File \(F\) to \(N\) Clients using P2P Approach:**
  - *Server Transmission:*
    - Must upload at least one copy.
    - Time to send one copy: F/us.
  
  - *Client Download:*
    - Each client must download a file copy.
    - Minimum client download time: F/Dmin
  
  - *Aggregate Download:*
    - Clients, as an aggregate, must download  NF bits.
  
  - *Maximum Upload Rate:*
    - The limiting maximum download rate is us + summation of ui

Formula is : **DP2P > max{F/us,F/dmin,NF/(us + Sui)} **
