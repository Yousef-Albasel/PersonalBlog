- **Domain Name System (DNS):**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - A distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of many name servers.
    - An application-layer protocol where hosts and name servers communicate to resolve names (address/name translation).

  - *Core Function:*
    - A core Internet function implemented as an application-layer protocol.

  - *Complexity:*
    - Complexity is at the network's "edge," involving people and various identifiers.

  - *Identifiers:*
    - For People: SSN, name, passport #
    - For Internet Hosts, Routers: IP address (32-bit) used for addressing datagrams, and a "name" (e.g., www.yahoo.com) used by humans.

- **DNS Services:**
  - *Hostname to IP Address Translation:*
    - Translates hostnames to IP addresses.
  
  - *Host Aliasing:*
    - Involves the use of alias names for hosts.
  
  - *Canonical, Alias Names:*
    - Represents both canonical (primary) and alias (alternative) names.
  
  - *Mail Server Aliasing:*
    - Facilitates aliasing for mail servers.
  
  - *Load Distribution:*
    - Supports load distribution, where many IP addresses correspond to one name.
  
  - *Replicated Web Servers:*
    - Multiple IP addresses corresponding to a single name for replicated web servers.

- **Why Not Centralize DNS?**
  - *Reasons:*
    1. **Single Point of Failure:**
    2. **Traffic Volume:**
    3. **Distant Centralized Database:**
    4. **Maintenance:**


- **DNS Resolution Process (First Approximation):**
  1. **Client Query Root Server:**
     - The client queries the root DNS server to find the DNS server for the ".com" top-level domain (TLD).
  
  2. **Client Query .com DNS Server:**
     - Using the information obtained from the root server, the client queries the ".com" DNS server to get the DNS server for "amazon.com."
  
  3. **Client Query Amazon.com DNS Server:**
     - With the ".com" DNS server information, the client queries the "amazon.com" DNS server to get the IP address for "www.amazon.com."


- **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers:**
  - *Responsibility:*
    - Responsible for top-level domains such as com, org, net, edu, aero, jobs, museums, and all top-level country domains (e.g., uk, fr, ca, jp).

  - *Examples:*
    - Network Solutions maintains servers for the .com TLD.
    - Educause is responsible for the .edu TLD.

- **Authoritative DNS Servers:**
  - *Role:*
    - Organization's own DNS server(s) providing authoritative hostname-to-IP mappings for the organizationâ€™s named hosts.

  - *Maintenance:*
    - Can be maintained by the organization itself or by a service provider.

- **DNS Caching:**
  - *Caching Behavior:*
    - Once any name server learns a mapping, it caches the mapping.
    - Cache entries have a timeout (Time To Live - TTL) and disappear after some time.

  - *TLD Server Caching:*
    - TLD servers are typically cached in local name servers, reducing the need to frequently visit root name servers.

  - *Root Name Servers:*
    - Root name servers are not often visited due to caching mechanisms.

  - *Out-of-Date Entries:*
    - Cached entries may be out-of-date, providing a best-effort name-to-address translation.

  - *Updates and Notification:*
    - If a name host changes its IP address, the change may not be known Internet-wide until all TTLs expire.
    - Update/notify mechanisms are proposed in the IETF standard RFC 2136.
