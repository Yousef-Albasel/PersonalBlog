#### - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
  - *Definition:* Web's application layer protocol.
  - *Model:* Follows a client/server model.
  
- **Client:**
  - *Role:* A browser that requests, receives, and "displays" Web objects.
  - *Protocol in Use:* Utilizes the HTTP protocol for communication.
  
- **Server:**
  - *Role:* A Web server that sends objects in response to client requests.
  - *Protocol in Use:* Utilizes the HTTP protocol for communication.


------------


- **Use of TCP:**
  - *Initiation:* Client initiates a TCP connection (creates socket) to the server on port 80.
  - *Acceptance:* Server accepts the TCP connection from the client.

- **HTTP Message Exchange:**
  - *Participants:* HTTP messages are exchanged between the browser (HTTP client) and the Web server (HTTP server).

- **TCP Connection Closure:**
  - *Closure:* The TCP connection is closed after the HTTP message exchange.

- **Statelessness of HTTP:**
  - *Characteristics:* HTTP is "stateless," meaning the server maintains no information about past client requests.
  - *Rationale:* Protocols that maintain "state" are complex.
  - *Challenge:* In the event of server/client crashes, views of "state" may be inconsistent and must be reconciled.

- **Non-persistent HTTP:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - At most one object is sent over a TCP connection.
    - The connection is then closed.
    - Downloading multiple objects requires multiple connections.

- **Persistent HTTP:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - Multiple objects can be sent over a single TCP connection between the client and server.


------------


- **Non-persistent HTTP Scenario:**
  1. **Client Initialization:**
     - *Action:* HTTP client initiates a TCP connection to the HTTP server (process) at `www.someSchool.edu` on port 80.
     - *Status:* HTTP server at host `www.someSchool.edu` is waiting for a TCP connection at port 80. It "accepts" the connection, notifying the client.

  2. **Request Transmission:**
     - *Action:* HTTP client sends an HTTP request message (containing the URL) into the TCP connection socket.
     - *Objective:* The message indicates that the client wants the object `someDepartment/home.index`.

  3. **Response Formation:**
     - *Action:* HTTP server receives the request message, forms a response message containing the requested object, and sends the message into its socket.
  4. **Connection Closure:**
     - *Action:* HTTP server closes the TCP connection.

  5. **Response Processing:**
     - *Action:* HTTP client receives the response message containing the HTML file, displays the HTML.
     - *Parsing:* The client parses the HTML file and identifies 10 referenced JPEG objects.

  6. **Repetition for JPEG Objects:**
     - *Steps 1-5 Repeated:* Steps 1-5 are repeated for each of the 10 JPEG objects.


- **Non-persistent HTTP Response Time:**
  - *Definition:*
    - **RTT (Round-Trip Time):** Time for a small packet to travel from the client to the server and back.
  - *Components of HTTP Response Time:*
    - One RTT to initiate the TCP connection.
    - One RTT for the HTTP request and the first few bytes of the HTTP response to return.
    - File transmission time.
  - *Formula:*
    - Non-persistent HTTP response time = 2RTT + File transmission time.

------------

- **Non-persistent HTTP Issues:**
  - *Challenges:*
    - Requires 2 RTTs per object.
    - OS overhead for each TCP connection.
    - Browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects.

- **Persistent HTTP:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - Server leaves the connection open after sending the response.
    - Subsequent HTTP messages between the same client/server are sent over the open connection.
    - Client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object.
    - As little as one RTT for all the referenced objects.


- **HTTP Status Codes:**
  - **200 OK:**
    - *Meaning:* Request succeeded, and the requested object is later in this message.

  - **301 Moved Permanently:**
    - *Meaning:* The requested object has moved, and the new location is specified later in this message (Location:).

  - **400 Bad Request:**
    - *Meaning:* The request message is not understood by the server.

  - **404 Not Found:**
    - *Meaning:* The requested document is not found on this server.

  - **505 HTTP Version Not Supported:**
    - *Meaning:* The HTTP version used in the request is not supported by the server.

------------

- **Cookies in Web Sites:**
  - *Components:*
    1. **Cookie Header Line (HTTP Response):**
       - Included in the HTTP response message.
    
    2. **Cookie Header Line (Next HTTP Request):**
       - Included in the next HTTP request message.
    
    3. **Cookie File on User's Host:**
       - Kept on the user's host and managed by the user's browser.
    
    4. **Back-end Database at Web Site:**
       - Used to store and manage information related to cookies.

### Web caches (proxy server)

- **Browser Cache Usage:**
  - *User Configuration:*
    - User sets the browser to access the web via the cache.

  - *Request Handling:*
    - Browser sends all HTTP requests to the cache.

  - *Cache Behavior:*
    - If the object is in the cache, the cache returns the object to the client.
    - If the object is not in the cache, the cache requests the object from the origin server, then returns the object to the client.

### Conditional Get
- **Conditional GET:**
  - *Objective:*
    - Avoid sending the object if the cache has an up-to-date cached version.
    - Minimize object transmission delay and lower link utilization.

  - *Cache Behavior:*
    - Specify the date of the cached copy in the HTTP request using `If-modified-since: <date>`.

  - *Server Response:*
    - If the cached copy is up-to-date, the server responds with `HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified`, containing no object.
