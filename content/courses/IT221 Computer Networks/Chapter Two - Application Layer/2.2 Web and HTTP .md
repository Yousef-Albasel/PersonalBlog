### Creating a Network application

- **Programs for Network Communication:**
  - *Objective:* Develop programs that run on different end systems and communicate over the network.
  - *Example:* Web server software communicating with browser software.
  - *Scope:* No need to write software for network-core devices, as they do not run user applications.
  - *Advantage:* Applications on end systems enable rapid application development and propagation.

#### Client - Server Architecture

- **Server:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - Always-on host.
    - Permanent IP address.
    - Utilizes data centers for scaling.

- **Clients:**
  - *Behavior:*
    - Communicate with the server.
    - May be intermittently connected.
    - May have dynamic IP addresses.
    - Do not communicate directly with each other.

### Peer-To-Peer Architecutre
- **Peer-to-Peer Network:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - No always-on server.
    - Arbitrary end systems directly communicate.
    - Peers request service from other peers and provide services in return.
    - Self scalability: New peers bring both new service capacity and new service demands.
    - Peers are intermittently connected and may change IP addresses.
    - Involves complex management.

#### - **Process:**
  - *Definition:*
    - A program running within a host.
  - *Communication Within Same Host:*
    - Two processes within the same host communicate using inter-process communication (defined by the operating system).
  - *Communication Between Different Hosts:*
    - Processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages.


#### - **Sockets:**
- **Message Exchange Through Sockets:**
  - *Process Interaction:*
    - A process sends/receives messages to/from its socket.
  - *Socket Analogy:*
    - A socket is analogous to a door.
  - *Message Sending:*
    - The sending process shoves the message out the door (socket).
  - *Transport Infrastructure:*
    - The sending process relies on the transport infrastructure on the other side of the door to deliver the message to the socket at the receiving process.

Socket are generally employed in client server applications. The server creates a socket, attaches it to a network port addresses then waits for the client to contact it. The client creates a socket and then attempts to connect to the server socket. When the connection is established, transfer of data takes place.

Socket example as a python program:

```py
import socket

# Create a socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to a specific address and port
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
server_socket.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections (max 1 connection in this example)
server_socket.listen(1)

print('Server is waiting for connections...')

# Accept a connection
client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
print('Connection from', client_address)

# Receive data from the client
data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print('Received:', data.decode())

# Send a response back to the client
message = 'Hello, client! This is the server.'
client_socket.send(message.encode())

# Close the sockets
client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
```

Client :

```py
import socket

# Create a socket object
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the server
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
client_socket.connect(server_address)

# Send data to the server
message = 'Hello, server! This is the client.'
client_socket.send(message.encode())

# Receive a response from the server
data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print('Received:', data.decode())

# Close the socket
client_socket.close()
```

- **Process Identifier:**
  - *Requirement:* To receive messages, a process must have an identifier.
  - *Host Identifier:* A host device has a unique 32-bit IP address.

- **Question:**

  - *Q:* Does the IP address of the host on which the process runs suffice for identifying the process?
>   - *Answer:* No, the IP address of a host alone is not sufficient for uniquely identifying a specific process running on that host.

- **Additional Identification:**
  - *Consideration:* To uniquely identify a process, additional information such as port numbers is used.
  - *Socket Concept:* The combination of the host's IP address and a port number, known as a socket, is used to identify a specific process on a specific host.

- **Communication Between Processes:**
  - *Key Pairing:* The pairing of IP address and port number is crucial for ensuring correct communication between processes, especially on different hosts.
- **Transport Services Needed by Applications:**
  - *Data Integrity:*
    - Requirement: Ensures the accuracy and reliability of data.
    - Example Apps: File transfer, web transactions, which require 100% reliable data transfer.
    - Note: Some applications, like audio streaming, can tolerate some data loss.

  - *Timing:*
    - Requirement: Low delay is crucial for the effectiveness of applications.
    - Example Apps: Internet telephony, interactive games.

  - *Throughput:*
    - Requirement: Some applications require a minimum throughput for effectiveness.
    - Example Apps: Multimedia applications.
    - Note: "Elastic apps" make use of whatever throughput they get.

  - *Security:*
    - Aspects: Encryption, data integrity, and other security measures.
    - Importance: Critical for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data.


#### - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
  - *Definition:* Web's application layer protocol.
  - *Model:* Follows a client/server model.
  
- **Client:**
  - *Role:* A browser that requests, receives, and "displays" Web objects.
  - *Protocol in Use:* Utilizes the HTTP protocol for communication.
  
- **Server:**
  - *Role:* A Web server that sends objects in response to client requests.
  - *Protocol in Use:* Utilizes the HTTP protocol for communication.


------------


- **Use of TCP:**
  - *Initiation:* Client initiates a TCP connection (creates socket) to the server on port 80.
  - *Acceptance:* Server accepts the TCP connection from the client.

- **HTTP Message Exchange:**
  - *Participants:* HTTP messages are exchanged between the browser (HTTP client) and the Web server (HTTP server).

- **TCP Connection Closure:**
  - *Closure:* The TCP connection is closed after the HTTP message exchange.

- **Statelessness of HTTP:**
  - *Characteristics:* HTTP is "stateless," meaning the server maintains no information about past client requests.
  - *Rationale:* Protocols that maintain "state" are complex.
  - *Challenge:* In the event of server/client crashes, views of "state" may be inconsistent and must be reconciled.

- **Non-persistent HTTP:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - At most one object is sent over a TCP connection.
    - The connection is then closed.
    - Downloading multiple objects requires multiple connections.

- **Persistent HTTP:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - Multiple objects can be sent over a single TCP connection between the client and server.


------------


- **Non-persistent HTTP Scenario:**
  1. **Client Initialization:**
     - *Action:* HTTP client initiates a TCP connection to the HTTP server (process) at `www.someSchool.edu` on port 80.
     - *Status:* HTTP server at host `www.someSchool.edu` is waiting for a TCP connection at port 80. It "accepts" the connection, notifying the client.

  2. **Request Transmission:**
     - *Action:* HTTP client sends an HTTP request message (containing the URL) into the TCP connection socket.
     - *Objective:* The message indicates that the client wants the object `someDepartment/home.index`.

  3. **Response Formation:**
     - *Action:* HTTP server receives the request message, forms a response message containing the requested object, and sends the message into its socket.
  4. **Connection Closure:**
     - *Action:* HTTP server closes the TCP connection.

  5. **Response Processing:**
     - *Action:* HTTP client receives the response message containing the HTML file, displays the HTML.
     - *Parsing:* The client parses the HTML file and identifies 10 referenced JPEG objects.

  6. **Repetition for JPEG Objects:**
     - *Steps 1-5 Repeated:* Steps 1-5 are repeated for each of the 10 JPEG objects.


- **Non-persistent HTTP Response Time:**
  - *Definition:*
    - **RTT (Round-Trip Time):** Time for a small packet to travel from the client to the server and back.
  - *Components of HTTP Response Time:*
    - One RTT to initiate the TCP connection.
    - One RTT for the HTTP request and the first few bytes of the HTTP response to return.
    - File transmission time.
  - *Formula:*
    - Non-persistent HTTP response time = 2RTT + File transmission time.

------------

- **Non-persistent HTTP Issues:**
  - *Challenges:*
    - Requires 2 RTTs per object.
    - OS overhead for each TCP connection.
    - Browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects.

- **Persistent HTTP:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - Server leaves the connection open after sending the response.
    - Subsequent HTTP messages between the same client/server are sent over the open connection.
    - Client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object.
    - As little as one RTT for all the referenced objects.


- **HTTP Status Codes:**
  - **200 OK:**
    - *Meaning:* Request succeeded, and the requested object is later in this message.

  - **301 Moved Permanently:**
    - *Meaning:* The requested object has moved, and the new location is specified later in this message (Location:).

  - **400 Bad Request:**
    - *Meaning:* The request message is not understood by the server.

  - **404 Not Found:**
    - *Meaning:* The requested document is not found on this server.

  - **505 HTTP Version Not Supported:**
    - *Meaning:* The HTTP version used in the request is not supported by the server.

------------

- **Cookies in Web Sites:**
  - *Components:*
    1. **Cookie Header Line (HTTP Response):**
       - Included in the HTTP response message.
    
    2. **Cookie Header Line (Next HTTP Request):**
       - Included in the next HTTP request message.
    
    3. **Cookie File on User's Host:**
       - Kept on the user's host and managed by the user's browser.
    
    4. **Back-end Database at Web Site:**
       - Used to store and manage information related to cookies.

### Web caches (proxy server)

- **Browser Cache Usage:**
  - *User Configuration:*
    - User sets the browser to access the web via the cache.

  - *Request Handling:*
    - Browser sends all HTTP requests to the cache.

  - *Cache Behavior:*
    - If the object is in the cache, the cache returns the object to the client.
    - If the object is not in the cache, the cache requests the object from the origin server, then returns the object to the client.

### Conditional Get
- **Conditional GET:**
  - *Objective:*
    - Avoid sending the object if the cache has an up-to-date cached version.
    - Minimize object transmission delay and lower link utilization.

  - *Cache Behavior:*
    - Specify the date of the cached copy in the HTTP request using `If-modified-since: <date>`.

  - *Server Response:*
    - If the cached copy is up-to-date, the server responds with `HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified`, containing no object.
