### Creating a Network application

- **Programs for Network Communication:**
  - *Objective:* Develop programs that run on different end systems and communicate over the network.
  - *Example:* Web server software communicating with browser software.
  - *Scope:* No need to write software for network-core devices, as they do not run user applications.
  - *Advantage:* Applications on end systems enable rapid application development and propagation.

#### Client - Server Architecture

- **Server:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - Always-on host.
    - Permanent IP address.
    - Utilizes data centers for scaling.

- **Clients:**
  - *Behavior:*
    - Communicate with the server.
    - May be intermittently connected.
    - May have dynamic IP addresses.
    - Do not communicate directly with each other.

### Peer-To-Peer Architecutre
- **Peer-to-Peer Network:**
  - *Characteristics:*
    - No always-on server.
    - Arbitrary end systems directly communicate.
    - Peers request service from other peers and provide services in return.
    - Self scalability: New peers bring both new service capacity and new service demands.
    - Peers are intermittently connected and may change IP addresses.
    - Involves complex management.

#### - **Process:**
  - *Definition:*
    - A program running within a host.
  - *Communication Within Same Host:*
    - Two processes within the same host communicate using inter-process communication (defined by the operating system).
  - *Communication Between Different Hosts:*
    - Processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages.


#### - **Sockets:**
- **Message Exchange Through Sockets:**
  - *Process Interaction:*
    - A process sends/receives messages to/from its socket.
  - *Socket Analogy:*
    - A socket is analogous to a door.
  - *Message Sending:*
    - The sending process shoves the message out the door (socket).
  - *Transport Infrastructure:*
    - The sending process relies on the transport infrastructure on the other side of the door to deliver the message to the socket at the receiving process.

Socket are generally employed in client server applications. The server creates a socket, attaches it to a network port addresses then waits for the client to contact it. The client creates a socket and then attempts to connect to the server socket. When the connection is established, transfer of data takes place.

Socket example as a python program:

```py
import socket

# Create a socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to a specific address and port
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
server_socket.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections (max 1 connection in this example)
server_socket.listen(1)

print('Server is waiting for connections...')

# Accept a connection
client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
print('Connection from', client_address)

# Receive data from the client
data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print('Received:', data.decode())

# Send a response back to the client
message = 'Hello, client! This is the server.'
client_socket.send(message.encode())

# Close the sockets
client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
```

Client :

```py
import socket

# Create a socket object
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the server
server_address = ('localhost', 12345)
client_socket.connect(server_address)

# Send data to the server
message = 'Hello, server! This is the client.'
client_socket.send(message.encode())

# Receive a response from the server
data = client_socket.recv(1024)
print('Received:', data.decode())

# Close the socket
client_socket.close()
```

- **Process Identifier:**
  - *Requirement:* To receive messages, a process must have an identifier.
  - *Host Identifier:* A host device has a unique 32-bit IP address.

- **Question:**

  - *Q:* Does the IP address of the host on which the process runs suffice for identifying the process?
>   - *Answer:* No, the IP address of a host alone is not sufficient for uniquely identifying a specific process running on that host.

- **Additional Identification:**
  - *Consideration:* To uniquely identify a process, additional information such as port numbers is used.
  - *Socket Concept:* The combination of the host's IP address and a port number, known as a socket, is used to identify a specific process on a specific host.

- **Communication Between Processes:**
  - *Key Pairing:* The pairing of IP address and port number is crucial for ensuring correct communication between processes, especially on different hosts.
- **Transport Services Needed by Applications:**
  - *Data Integrity:*
    - Requirement: Ensures the accuracy and reliability of data.
    - Example Apps: File transfer, web transactions, which require 100% reliable data transfer.
    - Note: Some applications, like audio streaming, can tolerate some data loss.

  - *Timing:*
    - Requirement: Low delay is crucial for the effectiveness of applications.
    - Example Apps: Internet telephony, interactive games.

  - *Throughput:*
    - Requirement: Some applications require a minimum throughput for effectiveness.
    - Example Apps: Multimedia applications.
    - Note: "Elastic apps" make use of whatever throughput they get.

  - *Security:*
    - Aspects: Encryption, data integrity, and other security measures.
    - Importance: Critical for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data.
