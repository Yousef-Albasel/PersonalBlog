#### Day One - Learning Web Dev via "TheOdinProject"

The reason I've started this section in my blog is that I'm about to begin a **web** **development** course in college, and I don't want to be left behind. While I already have some knowledge in **web** **development** from past practice, I've decided to start fresh. Learning from **The Odin Project** should make the process faster. Besides, I need to learn creating **JavaScript** web applications; it will make showcasing my personal projects much easier. It's time to give **C++** a rest.

The architecture for this section, and for the upcoming posts, is that I will only share notes I take and quotes from the website. **This is not a tutorial**, unlike the **OOP** section or the **OpenGL** ones. It's just a space where I drop down my notes, and each new day will have its own set of notes.
