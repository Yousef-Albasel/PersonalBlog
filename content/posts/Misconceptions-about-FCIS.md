High school exams are finished, and a lot of students have started looking for the perfect college to fit their ambitions and desires. Computer science has become the trend nowadays, with students from all steams wanting to join it. Unfortunately, a lot of misconceptions happen when it comes to talking about Computer Science college.

#### 1- It's all about coding
While coding is a big part of CS study, it's not the main focus. CS covers a wide range of topics, such as basic sciences (Mathematics, Physics), soft skill topics (Communication, Thinking, and Management), theoretical topics (Data structures, Algorithms, Theory of computation), Networking, computer architecture, and much more, that don't necessarily relate solely to pure coding skills (although those are covered later).

#### 2- Intense Mathematics
Having already covered why math is related to CS[ (you can check it here)](https://albasel.netlify.app/posts/math-and-computersci/ " (you can check it here)"), we can conclude that math is critical for CS students, but it's not that intense in general. It all depends on your thinking skills to find the best algorithm to solve a specific problem, and math comes in handy. However, that doesn't mean you will be studying some hard harsh math, unlike the math department in a Science college.

#### 3- It's only for nerds

**yes ** :nerd_face: :sleeping:

#### 4- Easy Study

It depends on what kind of person you are. If you are satisfied with getting D and D+ grades and doing simple calculator projects, then yes, it may seem easy.

On the other hand, if your goal is to secure a decent job, even if it's an entry-level position with a lower salary, you will need to study college subjects very well, excel in coding and problem-solving, and make some badass projects on your CV. This won't come easily; it will require hard work, dedication, and may even lose your physical and mental health. However, it's worth it. :smile:

#### 5- Easy Money

Only for those i mentioned in the earlier point.

#### 6-  College teaches only the basics


That's one of the biggest misconceptions I hear every day. We all know that academic university curriculum is never enough for landing a job. This is a global issue in every specialization worldwide. However, the misconception here is that people mix up learning basics and learning fundamentals. You can't start building AI models without understanding linear algebra and calculus. You can't excel in web development without learning to think algorithmically. Even though technology changes every second, fundamentals help you grow faster in any field.

College gives you a deep study into a lot of topics including: Advanced networking and communication systems, Compilers and Assembly, Computer Vision, Digital Signal Processing, Communication Technology, and Computer Architecture..etc.

and then you can learn any market track that won't be a problem.

#### 7- Can't i just cover all the curriculum myself?
Yes indeed, it's 2023.
But at some conditions : you are completely free and got enough time to focus on studying CS, and practise problem solving, making big projects and learn to work with a team. And you **ACTUALLY LOVE DOING IT.**

#### 8- Is it worthy?
I believe it's worth studying CS in college because you are constantly surrounded by a community that shares the same goals as you. Professors won't mislead you into thinking they will provide everything you need; instead, they guide you on what to do and how to fill the gap between academic learning and practical learning.

I think i covered a lot of misconceptions that no one speaks about, you can share your thoughts using the new disqus system i added to the site :)
